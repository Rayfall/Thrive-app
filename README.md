# Thrive
## Description
    Whether you are a stay-at-home parent, a college student or the CEO of a start-up, there are
    always tasks that need to be completed. Having a task app helps to alleviate some of the stress
    or anxiety caused by everyday life. Tasks apps can be used to keep track of meetings, make a
    grocery list, or just to put down a reminder for later in the day.
    With Thrive, however, you are able to share those tasks with friends, family members, or
    co-workers. This will help to lessen the burden of completing a task, or decreasing the chances
    of there being any miscommunication. With Thrive, there is an extra level of control in your
    day-to-day events
    
## Brief Example
    The main purpose of this project is to design a mobile task app for both iOS and Android devices.
    This app will allow users to not only document and keep track of their tasks, but also share their
    tasks with their friends, family, and co-workers as well. Those who have access to the tasks can
    interact with it, and make changes as needed. When changes are made to the task, the app will
    show what change was made, who made the change, and when it was made. An example of an
    interaction would be a husband picking up his daughter from soccer, and marking it as complete
    on his wifeâ€™s list of tasks. This way, the wife will know that the task has been completed, and she
    no longer needs to do it.
